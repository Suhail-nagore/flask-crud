Hello Developers 
in this project i covered the basic database operations on a web page using python
flask framework with sqlite3 database.
This project is very easy to understand since it has only 4 html files
which is used for providing the basic structure to the webpage
and one python file having all the route funtions.
the last file is database file in which some data already stored due to testing the web app


In this project, you just create a new student and enter the details into database.
and you can view the data of all the students using list.html file.
there is no edit and update operation performed due to its simplicity.
